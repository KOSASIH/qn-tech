# System Architecture

## Overview
The QN Tech system architecture is designed to facilitate secure and efficient integration of global banking systems and businesses with the Pi Network. The architecture is modular, scalable, and leverages advanced technologies such as quantum computing, blockchain, and artificial intelligence.

## Architectural Components
1. **User  Interface (UI)**
   - Web and mobile applications for user interaction.
   - Provides dashboards for monitoring transactions, partnerships, and analytics.

2. **API Gateway**
   - Acts as a single entry point for all client requests.
   - Handles authentication, routing, and load balancing.

3. **Microservices**
   - **Security Service**: Manages encryption, key distribution, and secure data transmission.
   - **Data Service**: Handles data storage, retrieval, and management.
   - **Contract Service**: Manages smart contracts and compliance checks.
   - **Analytics Service**: Provides data analytics and predictive modeling capabilities.
   - **Collaboration Service**: Facilitates real-time communication and project management.

4. **Database Layer**
   - Utilizes both SQL and NoSQL databases for structured and unstructured data storage.
   - Ensures data integrity and supports complex queries.

5. **Blockchain Layer**
   - Integrates with the Pi Network for decentralized data exchange and transaction validation.
   - Ensures transparency and immutability of records.

6. **Quantum Computing Layer**
   - Leverages quantum algorithms for advanced data processing and encryption.
   - Provides capabilities for real-time fraud detection and risk assessment.

## Deployment Architecture
- The system is deployed in a cloud environment, ensuring scalability and high availability.
- Utilizes containerization (e.g., Docker) for microservices deployment.
- Implements CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.

## Conclusion
The QN Tech architecture is designed to meet the demands of modern banking and business integration, ensuring security, efficiency, and scalability.
