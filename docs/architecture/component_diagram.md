# Component Diagram

## Overview
The Component Diagram provides a visual representation of the various components within the QN Tech system and their relationships. It highlights how each component interacts with others to deliver the overall functionality of the system.

## Components
1. **User  Interface (UI)**
   - Interacts with the API Gateway to send and receive data.
   - Displays information to users and allows for user input.

2. **API Gateway**
   - Acts as a mediator between the UI and backend services.
   - Routes requests to the appropriate microservices.

3. **Microservices**
   - **Security Service**: 
     - Interacts with the API Gateway for authentication.
     - Communicates with the Data Service for secure data storage.
   - **Data Service**: 
     - Handles data storage and retrieval.
     - Interacts with the Analytics Service for data processing.
   - **Contract Service**: 
     - Manages smart contracts and compliance checks.
     - Communicates with the Security Service for secure contract execution.
   - **Analytics Service**: 
     - Processes data from the Data Service and provides insights back to the UI.
   - **Collaboration Service**: 
     - Facilitates communication between users and teams.
     - Integrates with the UI for real-time updates.

4. **Database Layer**
   - Stores structured and unstructured data.
   - Interacts with the Data Service for data management.

5. **Blockchain Layer**
   - Validates transactions and ensures data integrity.
   - Communicates with the Contract Service for smart contract execution.

6. **Quantum Computing Layer**
   - Provides advanced processing capabilities for data analysis and encryption.
   - Interacts with the Security Service for enhanced security measures.

## Relationships
- The UI communicates with the API Gateway, which routes requests to the appropriate microservices.
- Each microservice interacts with the Database Layer for data storage and retrieval.
- The Security Service ensures that all data transactions are secure and compliant.
- The Analytics Service processes data and provides insights back to the UI for user consumption.
